# Dublin-rental-market-analysis

As a person who has been changing apartments a lot around Dublin, I like to check daft.ie website and see what kind of properties pop up there. Finding a good place to live in Dublin is gettig more diffucult due to the incrreasing rent and also fewer places available. It gave me an idea for this projcet- to compare how the rental market in Dublin has changed between September 2020 (in the middle of the pandemics) and post lockdowns- June 223. 
The Daft rental database from 2020 was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/d17129765/predicting-dublin-rental-daftie. The data from June 2023 I scraped myslef with the help of this tutorial: (https://kiransid0205.github.io/posts/post01/). 

I want to compare how the rents, number of properties available and overall prices between different parts of Dublin have changed between September 2020 and June 2023.
